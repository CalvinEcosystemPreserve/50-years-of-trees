# Calvin Eco Preserve Tree Data Analysis

## Our Vision and Summary

Our vision for this tree data census project was to provide Calvin’s community with publicly accessible predictive models and an interactive visualization of what the area of study looks like, how it has evolved over the years, and how it might change in the future.

Over the course of the semester, we worked collaboratively to bring this vision closer to reality. Davis created an interactive spatial visualization that shows how tree locations, diameters, and species composition have changed over time. The map includes a time slider and interactive features—users can hover over a tree to see its DBH and species, helping visualize long-term forest dynamics. Felicia developed a predictive model for tree growth using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), incorporating DBH, spatial location, and climate data such as precipitation and growing degree days. Her work provides the statistical foundation for forecasting future tree growth under different environmental conditions. Sucry focused on mapping and refining the spatial extent of the data, narrowing it to the two-hectare study area and cleaning elevation and height data to support spatial accuracy in both the map and the models.

Together, our work this semester resulted in the creation of an interactive map that tracks the evolution of tree growth in the Calvin Ecosystem Preserve over the past 50 years. Based on our analysis, we aimed to identify trends in species diversity, tree diameter, and environmental factors like elevation and climate, with a focus on how these elements have influenced tree growth patterns. Our hope was to reveal specific areas where growth has been significantly impacted by variables such as cumulative precipitation, temperature fluctuations, and the effects of diseases on trees. Additionally, we explored how spatial variables like elevation and the spatial distribution of species interact to shape the forest ecosystem. These findings will lay the groundwork for predictive models to visualize future tree growth and changes in the forest structure. Ultimately, our interactive visualization and predictive model will be uploaded to a website, making it publicly accessible for Calvin's community to explore, engage with, and contribute to the ongoing study of the Preserve.
